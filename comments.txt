-I'm waiting for the pepsi commercial where Kendall Jenner stops a workplace riot with an ice cold Pepsi-Cola.
 -Dear god, don’t give them ideas.
  -it already exists lol
   -If that's not proof we're living in dystopia idk what is.
    -I'm convinced that the ad executive that pitched that idea is a soulless demon in human form
     -Well they’re in marketing, so yes, definitely
   -I saw an Amazon commercial advertising Alexa automatically ordering someone breath mints after they yawned in the morning. In what world would I want something to spend my money when I yawn? Life gets more and more like GTA V every day.
    -“I can tell from your urinalysis that you’re a little low on iron John. I’ve taken the liberty of ordering supplements. They will arrive at your office this afternoon.”
     -Is that a bit from a movie? The Benchwarmers, I think.
     -That happens in the movie The Island I think
     -Family Guy, "Punish Your Toilet"
   -I think about this every time a business asks for me to donate to their charity while I’m paying for my stuff.How kind of you to donate my money…
    -Oh look you’ve given me the opportunity to donate to something I’ve never heard of…. You must be a good company.
     -Just ask what percentage of the donations get eaten up in salaries and administration. You’ll get a blank stare and a quick end to the conversation
     -The cashier is just doing their job and they have to ask you; if you want to be snarky to the company try their social media, not being snarky to the worker in front of you.
   -I saw that ad too, absolutely abysmal.
    -"I've went ahead and filled a prescription for antidepressants for you. With Prime Delivery you should receive your package by 8:00 pm."
   -Simple solution, don't get an alexa.
   -GTA V is pretty unrealistic, because if you work hard in that game, you can actually afford a nice house.
  -That's fucking disgusting lmao
    -it's so bad and out of touch its kind of hilarious.I think they were trying to go for the 2021 version of 1970 Coca-Colas famous Hilltop ad but could not have missed the mark more
     -That is still gross. But less so I guess lol
